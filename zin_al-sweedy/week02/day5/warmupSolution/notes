link my css file we need it
do slowely and check it
make sure have jquery in some foleder such as js folder
$ or jQuery in consle and return function it works jq
or type  log
and say  lo($); not work
could move our comments in jq
in hints
create  a hint div
create div then put id for her after that get the text
copy it and put it in div  then #word do css and display :non
it  is there put at top of the page at 0,0
using jq to do the question
var words=("#word").text().split('');// split on any of these things in []regexp + one or more split on array without these things
// no need for $ at words bec it is obj
 if .text  ();will print the text in red menas junk text
// get the var and put it in anew div bec it is hidden
// use random number too many time repate it so we could put it in diff vars

var $body =$('body');
// check it in console by randy();
// return func randy(max) put numb
var randy = function  (max){
return Math.floor.(Math)..........
}


console.log(words);
we need a random word from  the array words and pass the length
use the index in araay to acces the number
use the hints and pesudo words
insert these new words in a new div

var $ div=$('<div class="word">')// creat new div + class for it and once in bulit it and put bh html text word
put css to div
use size font using pt or px
no we need to append this div
to line are same
do the css in jq file for top using random
to give the location
but use the screen width.innerWidth and window.innerheight  to resize the screen
setInterval(func,100); call the function
it will run forever
debugger what var in that
if random index not defined probelm
$ for only html tags not for all vars and also works without it
not with normal vars
let mmake the word display in css #word Id will be display none
but in jq use fade hide or show
should start with display none first to show it or hide it
so  using fadIn and fade out
if fade in not working
less compelete version not have div
use jquery cdn
then put it in html script
fadein and fade out
fadein and fade out
 do many divs not good way
 so use function  by usinf this in ()bec it is js vanila not jq so $(this) become jq
 remove kill itself the dvis so create and remove these divs not too many

 code integration
  from jq use cdn version
  uncopmressed and there is code
  jQuery 3.x

jQuery Core 3.2.1 - uncompressed, minified, slim, slim minified
 give e code
