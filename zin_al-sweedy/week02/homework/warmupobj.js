// Badger's Revenge
//
// Fed up with students clapping him after every warmup, Badger devises a cunning plan to put an end to it -
// or at least look like he's putting an end to it. You see, Badger secretly enjoys the adulation - mocking though it may be -
// so he doesn't want the clapping to stop altogether.
//
// The names of those who are witnessed clapping Badger more than twice in the first four days of any one week will go into a
// draw. On Friday morning, a random name will be drawn from that list and the 'winner' will be forced to deliver the solution to
 // Friday's warmup.
//
// Create a program that Badger can use for this task - ideally, you should create an object (revengeOfBadger) to do this,
 // but if you can get it working using standalone functions, that's cool.
//
// Your program should:
//
// Track how many times each student in the class has clapped this week (just make up the numbers);
// Include a collection of candidates for the Friday draw (ie, a list of names of people who have clapped Badger more than
 // twice that week);
// Pick a random student to deliver the solution to Friday's warmup.
// If no one has clapped enough that week, the program should indicate that Badger has to do his own damned warmup.
