$('selector').show() and .hide() to bring and remove things from the page.

.each() is similar to for in loops, pass in a key and it will loop out all values.

$('div').each(function(element){
  console.log( element, this)
}); // this will log the ID attribute for each of the div elements this for-each loop runs through.
